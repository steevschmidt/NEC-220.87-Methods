## Expected Results by Calculation Method

The table below shows the expected Peak Power results (in kW) for each test file using different calculation methods:

| Test File | HEA-jupyter | HEA-python | HEA-JS | NEC | LBNL |
|-----------|-------------|------------|--------|-----|------|
| sample_15min | 5.00 | 5.00 | 5.00 | 5.00 | 5.00 |
| sample_hourly | 4.09 | 4.09 | 4.09 | 3.15 | 6.61 |
| sample_invalid | [fail] | Error | Error | Error | Error |
| sample_mixed | 4.09 | 4.09 | 4.09 | 3.40 | 6.61 |
| test1_orig | 4.21 | 4.21 | 4.20 | 4.21 | 6.72 |
| test2_hourly_1mo | 6.20 | 6.20 | 6.20 | 4.77 | 8.87 |
| test3_fake15_1mo | 10.71 | 10.71 | 10.71 | 8.24 | 13.44 |
| test4_15min_1mo | 9.46 | 9.46 | 9.46 | 9.46 | 9.46 |
| test5_15min_1yr | 27.85 | 27.85 | 27.85 | 27.85 | 27.85 |
| test6_15mPV_1m | 7.95 | 7.95 | 7.95 | 7.95 | 7.95 |
| pge_test1.csv | na | na | 12.36 | 12.36 | 12.36 |
| pge_test2.csv | na | na | 8.40 | 6.46 | 11.24 |

Other validation tests:
 1. Total Panel Capacity in kWh (not currently displayed) should equal the input Panel Capacity in Amps times the input Panel Voltage divided by 1000.
 2. The Peak Power in amps should equal the Peak Power in kW divided by the Panel Voltage and multiplied by 1000.
 3. The Remaining Capacity should equal the total panel capacity minus the Peak Power multiplied by the NEC Safety Factor (1.25).

## Calculation Methods

### HEA (Home Energy Analytics)
* Applies a 1.3x multiplier to hourly readings
* Applies both 4x and 1.3x multipliers to fake 15-minute data
* Applies only 4x multiplier to real 15-minute data
* Moderately conservative approach

### NEC (National Electrical Code)
* No adjustment to hourly readings
* Applies only 4x multiplier to fake 15-minute data
* Applies only 4x multiplier to real 15-minute data
* Least conservative approach

### LBNL (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory)
* For hourly values < 7.5 kW: 2.2 + 1.4 * hourlyValue
* For hourly values â‰¥ 7.5 kW: 5.2 + hourlyValue
* For fake 15-minute data, applies formula after 4x multiplier
* Most conservative approach, providing higher safety margins

## Data Format

### Standard Format
* CSV format
* Two columns: DateTime,kWh
* DateTime format varies by file
* kWh values as decimal numbers

### PG&E Format
* CSV format with header rows
* Multiple columns including: Start Time, End Time, Usage, Cost, Notes
* "Start Time" column used for DateTime
* "Usage" column used for kWh values
* May contain additional metadata in header rows

## Usage

These files can be used to:
1. Test the basic functionality of the calculator
2. Verify handling of different interval types
3. Validate error handling
4. Test visualization features
5. Verify data cleaning procedures
6. Test handling of real-world data anomalies
7. Compare results across different calculation methods
8. Validate format detection and parsing for different utility data formats
9. Test compatibility with PG&E energy usage exports
